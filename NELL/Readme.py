    When a DEV loves a QA <br/>
    Can't keep his mind on any code <br/>
    He'd debug all the errors <br/>
    For the quality she's known <br/>
    <br/>
    Yes, she's tough, oh so demanding <br/>
    But he's the champ, codes so well <br/>
    Even writes a testing framework <br/>
    Just to make her world excel <br/>
    <br/>
    Turns his back on his patterns <br/>
    If they don't pass her test <br/>
    When a DEV loves a QA <br/>
    He's precise in every line <br/>
    Crafting codes she envisioned <br/>
    <br/>
    He'd give up all his code-tricks <br/>
    And embrace the cleaner code <br/>
    If she said that's the way <br/>
    It ought to be <br/>
    <br/>
    Though she's strict, he's so adept <br/>
    Together they're a perfect duet
